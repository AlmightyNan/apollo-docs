# Time-difference

## What is the Time Difference Module?

> This command allows you to get the time difference between any two messages. You just need to make sure you have [developer mode](time-difference.md) enabled to get the message IDs. Apollo provides a very accurate time difference with even milli-seconds.

## Sub Commands for the Time-Difference Module

### a!timedif \<message-ID-1> \<message-ID-2>

> This command checks the time difference between two messages, whilst providing the IDs for both the messages.&#x20;
